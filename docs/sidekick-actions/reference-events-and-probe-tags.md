# ðŸ’¾ Reference Events & Probe Tags

Sidekick allows you to save reference stack events,  compare stacks, and control multiple logpoints and tracepoints using tags.

Reference stack events allow you to save the state of the stack at a time as a reference. Stack comparison allows you to compare the stack traces of two different executions of the application or with reference events to understand how the application's behavior has changed. This can be useful for identifying an issue's root cause or understanding the impact of a code change on the application's behavior.

Using tags to control multiple logpoints and tracepoints allows you to organize and manage logpoints and tracepoints more efficiently. For example, you could use tags to group logpoints and tracepoints by function or component, making it easier to manage and analyze the collected data.
