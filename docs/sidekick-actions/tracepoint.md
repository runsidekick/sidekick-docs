# ðŸ”Ž Tracepoint

Put tracepoints in your code and instantly see the snapshots of the application state, the call stack, captured variables, etc. without stopping the application.

A tracepoint is basically a non-breaking remote breakpoint. Tracepoints differ from ordinary breakpoints in two ways:

* First, it doesnâ€™t pause the code execution but just takes a screenshot of the variables when the code hits that line.&#x20;
* Second, itâ€™s integrated with Thundraâ€™s distributed technology enabling the connection between several tracepoints in the same transaction.&#x20;
