# ðŸš¨ Error Stack Collection

Automatic error stack collection is a feature of Sidekick that allows you to automatically collect the stack trace of an error as it occurs without requiring manual intervention. This can be a valuable tool for debugging and troubleshooting issues in an application, as it provides a detailed record of the application's execution at the time of the error, which can help you understand what caused the error and how to fix it.

This can be particularly useful in a live production environment, where time is often of the essence, and it is essential to identify and resolve issues as quickly as possible.
