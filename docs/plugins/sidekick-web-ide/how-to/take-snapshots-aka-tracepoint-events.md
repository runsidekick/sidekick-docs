# Take Snapshots (a.k.a Tracepoint Events)

After you [connect your source code](import-source-code.md), select [applications to debug](../introduction/apps-and-tracepoints-panel.md#selecting-applications-to-debug), and [put tracepoints,](set-tracepoints.md) Sidekick will automatically start taking snapshots, in other words; generating tracepoint events, when the remote application is executed.&#x20;
