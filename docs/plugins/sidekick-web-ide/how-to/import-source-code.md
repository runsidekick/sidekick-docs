# Connect Source Code

It's essential for Sidekick agents to know which branch/code you want to debug. By connecting your source code, you allow Sidekick to understand the correct source code and the correct tracepoint location. Currently, you can import your source code from your GitHub and Gitlab repositories.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Sidekick has only read-only access to your source code and never brings it to servers and keeps it in your browser.** &#x20;
{% endhint %}

To connect your source code, you need to follow the below steps: &#x20;

* Click on the "Edit" icon on [Source panel](../introduction/source-panel.md)
* Grant read-only access to Sidekick to your repositories in your account and organization.&#x20;
* Select a branch of your repository.&#x20;
* Voila! You can start browsing your source code in Sidekick.&#x20;
