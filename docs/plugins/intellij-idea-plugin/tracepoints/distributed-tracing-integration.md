# Distributed Tracing Integration

Sidekick integrates all tracepoints automatically with the rich distributed tracing so that you can see the tracepoint events with all the other actions that your application does end-to-end.

Sidekick offers different Tracing solutions for you to enable TraceMap of your application. Refer to our Tracing integrations to learn more:


<div className="w-full cols-1">
<Card title="Tracing Integration" target="../../../integrations/thundra-apm-tracing-integration" isNewWindow={false}>
</Card>
</div>

<br/>

After you integrate a Tracing solution, you can enable this feature using the “Enabled distributed tracing” checkbox in the edit popup:
