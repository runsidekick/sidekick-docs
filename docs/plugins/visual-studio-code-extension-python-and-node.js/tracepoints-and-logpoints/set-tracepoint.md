# Set Tracepoint

Setting up a tracepoint helps developers understand code execution on specific parts of an application. Itâ€™s as easy as setting up an ordinary line breakpoint with just one right-click on the desired line and selecting the Add Tracepoint button under the Sidekick section.&#x20;

![Note that the Sidekick tracepoint option is only available if you are already connected and have clicked on a line containing a valid expression inside a method.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-05-26 at 14.43.25.png>)

You can also add tracepoints using the command below:

* `Add Trace Point`
