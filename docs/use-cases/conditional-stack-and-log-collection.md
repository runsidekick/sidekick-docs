# Conditional Stack & Log Collection

Conditional stack and log collection is a debugging technique that allows you to selectively collect stack traces and log messages based on specified conditions. This can be useful in various situations, such as when you are trying to troubleshoot an issue in a live production environment or when you want to optimize the performance of your application.

One way that conditional stack and log collection can help you lower your monitoring costs is by allowing you to collect only the relevant data to the issue you are trying to resolve. For example, suppose you are experiencing a specific error in your application. In that case, you can set up a condition that triggers the collection of a stack trace and log messages only when the error occurs. This can help you avoid collecting large amounts of unnecessary data, which can reduce the overhead and cost of monitoring your application.

Conditional stack and log collection can also help you fix issues faster by providing you with more targeted and relevant data to work with. By collecting only the data relevant to the topic you are trying to resolve, you can more quickly identify the root cause of the problem and take the necessary steps to fix it.
