# Production Debugging

Production debugging refers to identifying and fixing issues that occur in a production environment, which is the environment where a software application or system is deployed and used by real users. Production debugging can be challenging, as it involves diagnosing and fixing problems that may not have been identified during the development or testing phases of the software.

There are a few key considerations when it comes to production debugging:

1. Time pressure: In a production environment, any downtime or issues can have serious consequences, so it's essential to identify and fix any problems that arise quickly.
2. Limited visibility: In a production environment, you may not have access to all the information and tools you had during development, making diagnosing and fixing issues more challenging.
3. Complexity: Production environments are often more complex than development environments, with multiple components and dependencies that can contribute to issues.

Some common strategies for production debugging include:

1. Monitoring: Use tools and processes to monitor the performance and behavior of the system in production, and alert on any issues or abnormalities.
2. Logging: Make sure that the system generates detailed logs that can be used to understand what's happening in production.
3. Reproducing issues: Try to reproduce the issue in a test or staging environment to understand the problem better and make it easier to fix.
4. Root cause analysis: Use tools and techniques to identify the root cause of the issue rather than just treating the symptoms.

Following these strategies and using the right tools and processes makes it possible to effectively debug and fix issues in a production environment.\


Sidekick Live Application Debugger is a tool that can be used to identify issues in these environments.

One of the critical features of Sidekick is its ability to provide detailed information about the application's state when an exception occurs, which can help speed up the debugging process. It can give information about the issue's context, such as the specific request or code that triggered it with the help of APM & OpenTelemetry integrations.

This can help minimize issues' impact on users and prevent downtime.

Tracepoints are a debugging technique that allows you to insert points into the code of an application that triggers a specific action when reached during execution. These actions include logging a message, collecting data, or pausing the application for further debugging.

Tracepoints can be helpful in a production environment because they allow you to gather information about the application's state at specific points in time without disrupting its regular operation. This can be particularly useful when you want to collect data about an issue that is difficult to reproduce or occurs infrequently.
