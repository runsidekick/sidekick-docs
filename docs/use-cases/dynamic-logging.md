# Dynamic Logging

Dynamic logging refers to modifying an application's log output while running without requiring a restart. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues in a live production environment. It allows developers to quickly and easily add or modify log statements in the application to collect more detailed information about its behavior.

One everyday use case for dynamic logging is temporarily enabling debug-level logging in specific areas of the code to help troubleshoot an issue. For example, if an application is behaving unexpectedly and the developer is unsure why they may use dynamic logging to insert debug-level log statements throughout the code to help understand what is happening at each step. This can be much faster and more efficient than manually reproducing the issue and stepping through the code line by line.

Overall, dynamic logging can be a valuable tool for debugging and troubleshooting issues in a live production environment, as it allows developers to quickly and easily modify the log output of the application to collect more detailed information about its behavior.
